Christopher is a software engineer who entered the tech scene through the hair-raising vector of penetration testing. 

It is his goal to build a cybersecurity career from this exciting childhood interest, so he can orchestrate best-practice catalysts and save the world from Black-Hats. 

In recent years, Christopher has leveraged his free time to become an experienced hackathon hacker (60+ competitions) and organizer ([HackingEDU](http://hackingedu.co) | [SiliconHacks](http://siliconhacks.com) | [Spectra](http://sospectra.com)), exercising his passion to educate, invent, and share. Christopher currently studies the triple threat of Computer Science, Information Security, and Latin Ballroom Dance.
